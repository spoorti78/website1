# website

This is my first time building a fully responsive website with HTML, CSS and javasript.

Design: In this stage, the website's overall layout and visual elements are created from the description provided. This includes designing the homepage, contact pages, menu.the fonts for both home and contact pages is downloaded from google fonts.

Development: This is where the website is built. This involves coding the website using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once the website has been built and  bugs have been fixed, it's ready to be deployed. This includes uploading the website to a server that is github pages in this case and making it live for users to access.
 
The main difficulty i faced with this project is sytle the project with CSS as i had only basic knowledge of CSS, i looked up for projects, video and inspiration for better styling design for the page and also the image uploaded was not loading in the page, that was one small difficulty i had, that i fixed it by checking the image link.
